**Session Date:** 2025-09-30
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary ðŸ“Š
**Participant:** Project Team

---

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Transform "discogs" project into reusable "sample_project" blank framework template

**Session Goals:** Create a clean, standardized full-stack framework template (PostgreSQL + React + Django Ninja + Python) that is fully Dockerized, cross-platform (Windows/Linux), and ready to use as a project starter with working validation dashboard.

**Techniques Used:** First Principles Thinking, Question Storming, SCAMPER Method

**Total Ideas Generated:** 4 core implementation strategies

### Key Themes Identified:
- Systematic renaming approach (discogs â†’ sample_project)
- Port standardization (increment all ports by +1)
- 100% containerized DevOps-ready deployment
- Working status dashboard for end-to-end validation
- Minimal complexity, maximum reusability

---

## Technique Sessions

### First Principles Thinking - 10 minutes

**Description:** Breaking down the fundamentals of what makes this framework valuable as a reusable template

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Must work out-of-the-box with single `docker compose up` command
2. All services containerized (frontend, backend, database) - no local dependencies
3. Cross-platform compatibility (Windows + Linux)
4. Clear validation mechanism (dashboard with status checks)
5. Clean database state (connection working, no project-specific data)
6. Use `docker compose` (not `docker-compose`) for modern Docker compatibility

**Insights Discovered:**
- The value is in simplicity and immediate usability
- DevOps deployment readiness is core requirement
- Validation/testing must be visual and immediate

**Notable Connections:**
- Containerization enables both development ease and production deployment
- Status dashboard serves dual purpose: validation and documentation

---

### Question Storming - 5 minutes

**Description:** Generate key questions that define what "production-ready blank template" means

**Ideas Generated:**
1. What ports should the new template use? â†’ All current ports +1
2. What should the frontend test display? â†’ Dashboard with status indicators (Frontend âœ“ | Backend API âœ“ | Database âœ“)
3. How clean should the database be? â†’ Connection working, remove discogs-specific data, keep init structure
4. What naming convention? â†’ sample_project throughout
5. Testing approach? â†’ `docker compose down -v && docker compose up --build`

**Insights Discovered:**
- Port increment pattern provides clear differentiation from source project
- Visual status validation is essential for confidence in template
- Database should demonstrate connection pattern, not contain sample data

---

### SCAMPER Method - 10 minutes

**Description:** Systematically adapt the existing system through Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify

**Ideas Generated:**

**Substitute:**
1. "discogs" â†’ "sample_project" in all files, configs, and container names
2. Ports: Jupyter 8999â†’9000, Django 8000â†’8001, React 8080â†’8081, PostgreSQL 5432â†’5433, PgAdmin 5050â†’5051
3. Database name: discogs_db â†’ sample_project_db
4. Email references: admin@discogs.com â†’ admin@sample_project.com

**Modify:**
1. Create health/status API endpoint in Django Ninja backend
2. Build frontend dashboard component with status checks
3. Keep database init folder structure, follow existing pattern

**Adapt:**
1. Frontend makes API calls to backend health endpoint
2. Backend health endpoint checks database connection
3. Dashboard displays real-time status for all three layers

**Eliminate:**
4. Remove any discogs-specific business logic from template

**Insights Discovered:**
- Systematic SCAMPER approach ensures nothing is missed
- Health check pattern creates self-documenting architecture
- Keeping config/init structure preserves template extensibility

**Notable Connections:**
- Health endpoint serves both dashboard and future monitoring needs
- Port increment pattern is simple rule that prevents conflicts

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities
*Ideas ready to implement now*

1. **Docker Compose Port and Naming Updates**
   - Description: Update both docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.dev.yml with +1 ports and sample_project naming
   - Why immediate: Foundation for all other changes, straightforward find-replace
   - Resources needed: Text editor, grep for finding all occurrences

2. **Backend Health API Endpoint**
   - Description: Create `/health` or `/status` endpoint in Django Ninja that checks database connection
   - Why immediate: Simple endpoint, follows existing Django Ninja patterns
   - Resources needed: Django Ninja knowledge, database connection testing

3. **Systematic Name Replacement**
   - Description: Grep all "discogs" references and replace with "sample_project"
   - Why immediate: Automated search-replace operation
   - Resources needed: Grep/find tools, careful file-by-file review

### Future Innovations
*Ideas requiring development/research*

1. **Enhanced Dashboard Template**
   - Description: Expand dashboard beyond status checks to include navigation, sample widgets, theme toggle
   - Development needed: React component library selection, design system
   - Timeline estimate: Post-MVP, 2-3 days

2. **Environment Configuration Generator**
   - Description: Script to auto-generate .env files with custom project names and ports
   - Development needed: Shell script or Python script development
   - Timeline estimate: 1-2 days after template stabilizes

### Moonshots
*Ambitious, transformative concepts*

1. **Interactive Template Generator CLI**
   - Description: Command-line tool that asks questions (project name, ports, features) and generates customized project
   - Transformative potential: Makes template truly reusable across many projects
   - Challenges to overcome: CLI development, template variable system, testing matrix

### Insights & Learnings

- **Simplicity is the product**: Resisting feature creep keeps the template truly reusable
- **Docker-first approach**: Containerizing everything eliminates "works on my machine" problems and enables DevOps
- **Visual validation matters**: Dashboard status checks provide immediate confidence the template works
- **Port increment pattern**: Simple +1 rule prevents conflicts when running multiple projects
- **Keep existing patterns**: Following current config/init structure preserves institutional knowledge

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Docker Configuration Updates

- **Rationale:** Foundation for everything - ports and naming must be correct first. All other components depend on these base configurations.
- **Next steps:**
  1. Update docker-compose.yml (ports +1, rename all "discogs" â†’ "sample_project")
  2. Update docker-compose.dev.yml (same changes)
  3. Update container names, database names, environment variables
- **Resources needed:** Text editor, Docker compose reference documentation
- **Timeline:** 30 minutes

#### #2 Priority: Frontend Dashboard with Status Checks

- **Rationale:** Validates that the template works end-to-end and provides visual confirmation for developers using the template
- **Next steps:**
  1. Create backend health API endpoint (Django Ninja)
  2. Create frontend status check component (React)
  3. Build dashboard layout displaying Frontend âœ“ | Backend API âœ“ | Database âœ“
  4. Integrate API calls and real-time status updates
- **Resources needed:** React knowledge, Django Ninja API patterns, fetch/axios for API calls
- **Timeline:** 2-3 hours

#### #3 Priority: Systematic Name Replacement

- **Rationale:** Ensures no hidden "discogs" references remain that could confuse future developers or cause bugs
- **Next steps:**
  1. Grep all files for "discogs" references
  2. Review each occurrence for context
  3. Replace systematically (backend, frontend, configs, database references)
  4. Test after replacement
- **Resources needed:** Grep/ripgrep, find tools, careful file review
- **Timeline:** 1-2 hours

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well
- Question-driven approach quickly clarified requirements
- SCAMPER provided systematic framework for transformation planning
- Focus on simplicity kept scope manageable
- Real project files provided concrete context

### Areas for Further Exploration
- Automated testing strategy: How to validate template works across Windows and Linux automatically
- Documentation: README template for projects created from this framework
- Version management: How to update projects when template improves
- Feature toggles: Optional components users can enable/disable (e.g., PgAdmin, Jupyter)

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques
- **Assumption Reversal**: After implementation, challenge assumptions about what "must" be in the template
- **Five Whys**: If any component proves difficult to templatize, dig into root causes
- **User Testing**: Have someone unfamiliar with project try to use template and observe pain points

### Questions That Emerged
- Should we version the template (v1.0.0)?
- How will projects created from this template receive updates?
- Should there be multiple template variants (minimal vs full-featured)?
- What documentation should be included in the template itself?

### Next Session Planning
- **Suggested topics:** Documentation strategy, automated testing approach, template versioning system
- **Recommended timeframe:** 2-3 weeks after initial template implementation
- **Preparation needed:** Usage feedback from first project(s) created from template
